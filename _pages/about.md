I'm currently a post-doc in the analysis group at TU Delft. Previously I was a MIGS research fellow at the University of Edinburgh and a post-doc at EPFL Lausanne. I obtained my PhD in December 2022 at the University of Edinburgh under supervision of István Gyöngy.

My research areas include:
- Well-posedness theory of SPDEs
- stochastic reaction diffusion systems
- regularization by noise for SDEs and
- filtering theory for SDEs.

On this site you can find more information about me and my research.
